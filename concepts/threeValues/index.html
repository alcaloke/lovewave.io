				<h2 id="sensibility">Sensibility</h2>
				<p>Sensibility is the ability to directly perceive what a thing is <i>sensually</i> before using words and ideas to describe it.</p>
				<p>For example when a person encounters a red rose, one <i>senses</i> what the particular shade of red it is; the shape and size of its bulb; the scent of its fragrance & so on. However such direct perception of a rose is interrupted by the conceptual idea of what a red rose is to the person who encounters it. For example, since a red rose has become the symbol of love in most cultures, it may bringing up ideas associated with one’s romantic life.</p>
				<p>Our mission is to encourage people to develop their ability to directly perceive the things they encounter by prolonging the time spent on sensing what the particular form, color, sound, texture and scent it has, rather than associating it with ideas of all kinds. Why? We think that developing one’s sensibility is the foundation for experiencing a joyful and uncomplicated life; that which comes from utilising one’s creativity.</p>
